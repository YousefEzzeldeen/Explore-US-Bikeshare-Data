Congrats to me :D
I finished the project in less than 3 days .. not bad as a beginner I think, yet i feel more like at some point 
I must learn more and more to improve.
Honestly I didn't understand every single line of the code yet. 
There are some nested functions and methods I need to practice more to make the best use of programming. 
thank you for being there for us and we are looking forward for more. :)
